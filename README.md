# MIS.ExcelReport
The Excel MIS (Management Information System) report on Employee Daily Sales is a comprehensive tool designed to track and analyze sales data on a daily basis. The report consists of several columns, including SINo, Name, Item, Quantity, Rate, and Amount. These headers provide a structured format for capturing and presenting relevant information.

To enhance the usability and visual appeal of the report, various Excel features and functionalities have been utilized. Firstly, a table has been created to organize the data, enabling easy sorting, filtering, and manipulation of information. The table functionality ensures that any new entries or modifications are automatically included and updated within the data range.

Furthermore, the report has been formatted to improve readability and aesthetics. This formatting includes applying appropriate font styles, cell colors, and borders to enhance the overall presentation of the data.

To calculate the subtotals for each column, the SUBTOTAL formula has been employed. This formula allows for the automatic calculation of various summary functions, such as sums, averages, and counts, while excluding any filtered or hidden rows. Using the SUBTOTAL formula ensures accurate and dynamic calculations as the data in the report evolves.

Another notable feature incorporated in the report is the Slicer. Slicers provide an interactive way to filter data based on specific criteria. By selecting values from the Slicer, users can dynamically filter the report based on different parameters, such as specific employees, items, or dates. This functionality enhances the report's flexibility and enables users to focus on specific subsets of data based on their requirements.

By uploading the Excel MIS report on GitHub, it becomes easily accessible and shareable with other stakeholders, such as managers, team members, or stakeholders. GitHub provides a version control system, allowing for tracking changes and collaborating on the report effectively.

Overall, the Excel MIS report on Employee Daily Sales offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for tracking, analyzing, and reporting sales data. Through the use of tables, formatting, the SUBTOTAL formula, and Slicers, the report provides valuable insights into daily sales activities and facilitates data-driven decision-making processes.
